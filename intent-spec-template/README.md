# Intent Specification Template

This repository provides a **standard, AI-native way to define systems using intent rather than implementation**.

It introduces two complementary files:

- **INTENT.md** — defines what a system *means*
- **RAG.md** — defines what an AI should *know* while reasoning about it

Philosophy:
- Intent before code
- Meaning before implementation
- Declarative over procedural
- Execution is disposable; intent is durable
